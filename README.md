# Data Analyst with Python and Colab Project

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks designed for data analysis using Python, specifically within the Google Colab environment. Each notebook demonstrates various data analysis techniques and machine learning methods using popular Python libraries such as Pandas.

## Notebooks

### 1. Diamonds_and_FIFA_Data.ipynb
This notebook focuses on analyzing two datasets: a diamonds dataset and a FIFA player dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of basic machine learning models.

### 2. Marvel,_Earthquakes_and_International_football_Data.ipynb
In this notebook, we explore three different datasets: Marvel character data, earthquake data, and international football data. The analysis covers data visualization, statistical analysis, and the use of machine learning techniques to gain insights from the data.

### 3. Twitter_Data.ipynb
This notebook is dedicated to analyzing Twitter data. It includes text processing, sentiment analysis, and the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to derive meaningful insights from tweets.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions, relationships, and trends using various plotting libraries.
- **Machine Learning:** Applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to make predictions and discover patterns.
- **Pandas:** Utilizing the powerful Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Google Colab:** Running and sharing notebooks in the cloud for easy collaboration.

## Getting Started

To get started with these notebooks, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Yarin-Shohat/Data-Analyst-With-Python.git
    ```
2. **Open Google Colab:**
    - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
    - Select `File` > `Upload notebook` and upload the desired `.ipynb` file from the cloned repository.

3. **Install necessary libraries:**
    Each notebook contains a cell to install the required libraries. Run this cell before proceeding with the analysis.
    ```python
    !pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```
